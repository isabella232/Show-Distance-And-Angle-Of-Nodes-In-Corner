# Show Distance And Angle in Corner

This is a fork of the original [Show Distance and Angle Plugin]() by [@Mark2Mark]() that shows the data in the corner.

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It shows the direct distance of two selected elements (`Nodes, Anchors, Components`) and their angle. The times of temporaryly created guidelines are passé.

### Install

1. Install via the Plugin Manager in Glyphs.
2. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show * Distance and Angle in Corner` from the view menu.

### Examples
